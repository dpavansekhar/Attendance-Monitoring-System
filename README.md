# 📌 Attendance Monitoring System using OpenCV

## 📖 Overview
This project is an AI-powered **Attendance Monitoring System** that leverages **Machine Learning** and **OpenCV** to automate student attendance tracking. The system records **entry and exit times** of students, detects **unknown faces**, and logs attendance details in an **Excel file** for easy access and analysis. This enhances security, reduces manual effort, and ensures accuracy in attendance management.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Face Recognition:** Identifies and verifies students in real time using OpenCV.  
✅ **Automated Entry & Exit Logging:** Captures and records timestamps efficiently.  
✅ **Unknown Face Detection:** Detects and flags unauthorized individuals for security.  
✅ **Excel File Storage:** Saves attendance logs in a structured spreadsheet.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and easy-to-use system for institutions.  

## 🛠 Technologies Used
🔹 **Python** - Core programming language.  
🔹 **OpenCV** - Real-time face detection and recognition.  
🔹 **Machine Learning** - Enhancing face recognition accuracy.  
🔹 **Pandas** - Managing and exporting data in Excel format.  

## 📥 Installation
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/attendance-monitoring.git
   ```
2️⃣ **Install Required Dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy pandas face-recognition
   ```
3️⃣ **Run the System:**  
   ```bash
   python attendance_system.py
   ```

## 🎯 Usage Guide
📌 **Step 1:** Register students by capturing their facial images and storing them in the dataset.  
📌 **Step 2:** Start the system to begin real-time face recognition and attendance tracking.  
📌 **Step 3:** Attendance data, including timestamps, is logged and stored in an Excel file.  
📌 **Step 4:** Review attendance records for verification and analysis.  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
✨ **RFID or QR Code Integration** - Multi-factor authentication for better security.  
✨ **Cloud-Based Data Storage** - Access attendance logs remotely.  
✨ **Deep Learning Models** - Improve face recognition accuracy.  
✨ **Mobile App Support** - Real-time tracking via mobile devices.
